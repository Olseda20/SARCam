# Search and Rescue Drone Camera System
This will be where I work on developing a camera system that will be used on a Search and Rescue drone.

## Camera Configuration
This camera system will consist of a Pair of Visual + Thermal modules.
One pair will be wide angle cameras for wide coarse searches. 
The other pair will be narrow angle cameras for close distance searching.

## Goal
The overall goal of this system is to analyse areas and locate victims lost that may be lost
in the scottish mountains. 
The visual cameras are important for clear vision of the scene and the thermal cameras can be utilised for 
their benifits of analysing temperature differentials in different scenes.

concepts of saliency, confidence levels can be ge
