# Search and Rescue Drone Camera System
This will be where I work on developing a camera system that will be used on a Search and Rescue drone.

## Camera Configuration
This camera system will consist of a Visual ArduCam Module + Thermal Seek Pro Compact thermal camera module.
It will use a Raspberry Pi 4b as the micro processor
These will be mounted onto a gimbal for support. (intended to be operated through mavlink)

## Goal
The overall goal of this system is to analyse areas and locate victims lost that may be lost
in the scottish mountains. 
The visual cameras are important for clear vision of the scene and the thermal cameras can be utilised for 
their benefits of analysing temperature differentials in different scenes.
